# Group03_FinalProject
A program that helps the user find their next car easier and faster. 
Uses graphing, searching and sorting on a big dataset to accomplish this.

Data folder
-Contains data bases in .csv format. 

####Deployment Document
1) Run the `main` under gui.Gui1<br />
2) Select at least one car type<br />
3) Select car condition and specify price range(optional)<br />
4) Select at least one property, and rank each property (optional)<br />
5) At most 5 cars will be outputted as a result (their name + purchase link).<br />
You can click next/back to go through them.<br />

######Notes:
- For example inputs, please refer to UserTest.pdf
- The program will take long to run if there is a lot of data to parse
- There are much more used cars then new, therefore selecting used condition (or I don't know = new + used),
will yield better results.
- Add a price range is recommended to speed up the program
- Some links may be expired as the data was created several weeks ago
