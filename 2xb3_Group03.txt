Design decision: 
Aside from testing important classes separately using JUnit 
we decided to test our program's final output by conventional means because it was
really difficult to test a program which outputs subjective results. To do this we got our friends
to test the program and decide whether the outputs were accurate. We received very
positive results where 3/5 testers said the results were "very accurate" and 2/5 said "accurate"
